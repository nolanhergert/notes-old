You (Nolan) aren&#039;t necessarily very good at economic development. But, you&#039;re apparently pretty good at getting paid a lot of money for doing something you don&#039;t mind and even like sometimes!. So…give money instead. But! be “open” / “willing” to change to something as frustrating and gut-wrenching as ministering to murderous tribesmen. How&#039;s that for laying down your pride!

Found it was hard to advance at Intel as a person that enjoyed software. Grade 7+, you had to show hardware advances + papers. Etc. Intel probably wouldn&#039;t keep him at the same pay grade for 20 years (they kind of require ppl to move up, clarify), so he&#039;d get laid off eventually anyways. Might as well move to a software style company now and get paid more and likely stay around longer, making software advancements.
 leet coder, paid. CS concept refresher.

Also really practiced behavioral interview questions. Do you align with the company&#039;s philosophy? Buy some nice new clothes. Practice in the mirror and have 1-2 examples for each question.

Today I don&#039;t really want to write more documentation. We haven&#039;t done it that much, thankfully, but agonizing over every last word for a dumb CLI command so meaning is clear and we aren&#039;t grammatically incorrect isn&#039;t my cup of tea right now, regardless of how many people it helps.

Is it so bad to work on a project for a while? To switch basically means to lose most of the understanding and ability to make good architecture level conclusions…however it&#039;s good to mix it up and check out what other people are doing too!

<h4 id="aep_celebration">AEP Celebration</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Good time. Had a question for Mohamed, but was basically interrupted from someone in marketing/sales who had a long discussion about plans for future products and to whom 10s of millions of dollars were in the balance. A rather important conversation with several miscommunications resolved, only occurring because of a celebration for a previous generation product because one person was in Arizona and another in Oregon.
</p>

<p>
Mohamed answered my question about “why only 6 AEP dimms on CLX vs. 12” saying that customers &lt;always?&gt; wanted to shore up aep bandwidth with ddr4.

<p>
Looking at OpenWater req, I am disappointed that I&#039;m not practiced/skilled in that work. It&#039;s definitely approachable. I also like it because they so clearly are improving things for a lot of folks.
</p>

<p>
Also, I was doing some thinking earlier today. It&#039;s likely that code generation systems will start taking off in the next 20 years. All you have to do is provide examples, specs of what you want. What jobs will remain, since programming (in the typical sense, “talking computer”) is heading out the door?

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Working with hardware, new sensors / physics</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Debugging? Knowing where to look.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think I&#039;m most motivated by the outcome, the application. If that&#039;s even at all generic or worse for things I don&#039;t agree with, then not as much fun. 
</p>

<p>
Other than learning about the basics of reducing expenses and investing the extra in a wise low-overhead way, I don&#039;t really like spending my life trying to outsmart the market in a highly researched way. It feels like there&#039;s no gain to society in general by betting on stocks, and soon I won&#039;t need more money (which is the main outcome from that). Granted, for startups and things they need capital to innovate and deliver, so I guess that&#039;s useful, but I mostly want to enable good tech and not make a bunch of money off of it.

Hey. Just a friendly suggestion. When describing issues, stick to the data/facts and try not to add the emotional comments. I saw similar in some of your source code comment blocks. No need to add hysteria to an already hysterical program 😉

<p>
The UEFI driver in its current state *will* attempt to “correct” this LSA upon restart of the platform. Unfortunately it has the same behavior as <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> and freaks out, seeming to revert to a backup state, even though it seems to read the namespaces/regions perfectly fine. <strong>*this causes data “misplacement”</strong>*, and we need to determine desirable behavior soon.
</p>

<p>
Also, above comment, when I read it seems to suggest UEFI driver is at fault. Reality is that UEFI driver is following <abbr title="specification">spec</abbr> and Linux left LSA in bad state…

<p>
No big deal, just suggestions…

I would really enjoy working at a place where we are constantly pushing to do things better and dream about what is possible as opposed to settling for going the boring less thinking route and doing things how they&#039;ve always been done.

Though I have been a lover of the grandeur of skies and mountains and oceans my whole life, at age twenty I was beginning to understand that all of life was not glory— in sad fact, that much of it was awful, that there was much unhappiness in human hearts, and that <strong>superficial responses only aggravated the problem</strong>.

<blockquote><div class="no">
 When our lives are smashed to bits, and it feels like the ground has disappeared from under us, we look for guidance, for our North Star, for a light that can provide meaning and direction to what remains of our life.</div></blockquote>

<p>
For me, this light lies in unconditional love. This is something that I wish to remember not only at an intellectual level, but at a more visceral level as well. I want to feel truth.
</p>

<p>
So I made a simple story, a fable. Stories are powerful because they engage our imagination, bringing abstract concepts to life inside of us. This one uses the familiar characters of God and the Devil, but you needn&#039;t believe in anything supernatural to understand it.
</p>

<p>
Long ago, the Devil boasted that he could easily gather more followers than God. God&#039;s way of gathering followers was simple: give everyone Unconditional Love and Forgiveness, nothing more and nothing less. Naturally the Devil was more devious. He knew that most people would not knowingly follow the Devil, so his plan was to lie and claim that he was the One True God, promise his followers a great reward in the afterlife, and threaten that those who didn&#039;t worship him would be sent to hell when they died. God was betting on Love, but the Devil believed that Greed and Fear are stronger than Love, and therefore even good people could be tricked into following him.
</p>

<p>
The God of Unconditional Love and Forgiveness brings union through love. The false Gods bring division through fear and greed. If a God promises to reward you with 72 virgins in paradise in exchange for flying an airplane into a building, it&#039;s a false God (or a false image of God, if you prefer). If a God threatens to send you to hell for loving the wrong person, it&#039;s a false God. If a God tells you to coerce people into worshiping him, it&#039;s a false God. If a God promises protection in exchange for doing his bidding, it&#039;s a false God.
</p>

<p>
Genuine, unconditional love is a gift that must be freely given and freely accepted, with nothing expected in return. Love can not be delivered at gun point, or with the threat of eternal damnation.
</p>

<p>
In this winter of fear, suffering, and division, the God of Unconditional Love gives comfort and direction. His spirit is reborn in our hearts when we give the gift of unconditional love and forgiveness to others and, most urgently, to ourselves. – Paul Bucheit, from <a href="http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-gift.html" class="urlextern" title="http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-gift.html" rel="ugc nofollow">another blog post</a>

  It depends on who you&#039;re talking about. It seems to me the <strong>evangelical</strong> tradition tends to talk a lot about how faith essentially spiritually helps you deal with the troubles and the stresses of work. You need help to face challenges. <strong>Mainline churches</strong> tend to put more emphasis on social justice and basically did a critique of capitalism early on, so whenever the mainline churches or ecumenical movement did faith-and-work stuff, it was usually critiquing the market, not “how&#039;s your heart?” The <strong>Lutheran</strong> stream emphasizes that all work is God&#039;s work. Worldview doesn&#039;t matter. You make a good pair of shoes, then you&#039;re doing God&#039;s work, because work is God&#039;s way of caring for creation. The <strong>Calvinist</strong> stream was more like yes, it&#039;s not just you are caring for creation through work, but you are shaping it. and therefore your beliefs have an impact. When you put those four streams together, I think they&#039;re very comprehensive. If you isolate them from each other, they can create idiosyncrasies at best and imbalances at worst. – From Tim Keller in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Every-Good-Endeavor-Connecting-Your/dp/0525952705" class="urlextern" title="http://www.amazon.com/Every-Good-Endeavor-Connecting-Your/dp/0525952705" rel="ugc nofollow">Every Good Endeavor</a></div></blockquote>
