Many people justify their argument by making a model of reality and then state conclusions that can be made from that model. However, if the model doesn&#039;t sufficiently describe reality (whether Cardiac Output estimation or economics), than you need to do more study and testing with real-world data before you can make any conclusions.

Jay Heinrichs Rhetoric / Arguing book is good intro. Trying to find a good theology justification and intro book too. Maybe Pastor Matt is best bet, otherwise “A Little Book for Theologians: Why and How to Study Theology” seem good too.

Hazlitt thinks neglect of thinking is an evil, almost a superset of all the other evils.
Normative science seeks to produce a “norm” or ideal, based on information found by “positive” subjects. The science of thinking is a normative science.
Logic is helpful too.
