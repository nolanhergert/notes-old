Keller wants to counter the claim that you must give up on rationality to believe in Christianity/religion. In fact, you adopt a set of beliefs when you believe either secularism or Christianity.
</p>

<p>
We can&#039;t really know anything for sure. This is what Glenn calls solipsism.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Agreed. Let&#039;s assume reality around us though! It makes for more interesting discussion.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So Keller&#039;s later point is we can&#039;t prove whether there is a God or not. Nor can we prove that the natural world is all there is! <em>Ok, true. What&#039;s the point? </em> Therefore there is room for God. <em>Ok, sure</em>

Holocaust, natural disasters. Would you want to hang out with this person? Do you realize the gravity of the situation?</div>

Keller claims it was from the Bible.
</p>

<p>
So what that it appeals to me today? I want <strong>the truth</strong>! I want to know reality!
</p>

<p>
“If there is no transcendent reality beyond this life, then there is no value or meaning for anything”
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> How again? I think he describes it, just need to read a few more times.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h5 id="naturalism">Naturalism</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
“Man descended from apes, therefore we should love our neighbor”
</p>

<p>
Often people assume Christian ideas and try to fit them into their other beliefs without justificaiton. Because they believe it to be right.
</p>

<p>
Keller&#039;s point isn&#039;t that Christianity is absolutely better to naturalism from this perspective, but rather that naturalism isn&#039;t so “truth-based” after all.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="ch__3">Ch ... 3?</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Early main point is that a naturalist can&#039;t escape the ultimate meaningless-ness of the universe. You can ignore it and make up meaning for yourself, but it is lacking in facing “the truth”.
</p>

<p>
Also, without ultimate meaning, or by saying “everyone defines his or her own meaning” then how can you disagree about something someone else chooses to do? <em>Well, you can do anything except harm.</em> What is harm, and how can it be derived objectively?
</p>

<p>
So therefore discovered meaning is better than created meaning. It&#039;s objective! It&#039;s actually true!
</p>

<p>
For religious people, suffering on Earth can bring you closer to God. <em>However, except when God is causing the suffering?</em>
</p>

<h5 id="does_the_bible_describe_a_fiery_burny_place">Does the Bible describe a Fiery burny place?</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
Keller basically says FIRE of Hell isn&#039;t literal, rather it&#039;s the misery and self-loathing you experience as a result of making yourself God instead of relying on God. In other words, Hell is your ego and your false self whether that&#039;s your anger, lust, bad habits, lifestyle etc. Then he points to CS Lewis who says We choose this “Hell” ourselves. OK, I like that and it makes me feel a lot better….for about 30 seconds until my brain starts saying <strong>“But what about all those  places in the Bible that describes Hell as a place of Fire and torment and gnashing of teeth?” What about all the Traditional teachings about Hell as a literal place through 2000 years of church history? What if it&#039;s not just allegorical? What if CS Lewis&#039;s idea was just his theory or hypothesis or rationalization?</strong> Keller&#039;s brain might be satisfied with a Lewis Bible interpretation, but my brain can&#039;t ignore the dozens of Hell warnings in the Bible. How does Keller know when the Bible is speaking literally and when it&#039;s speaking allegorically?﻿
