Useful when self-employed. Allows you to give the full amount (~$50k or whatever) to 401k. However, there&#039;s still a “traditional” / elective deferral / “don&#039;t pay taxes” limit of the typical 19K. So there&#039;s no benefit to trying to do this method as a contractor because Intel now supports the mega backdoor roth. (the same benefit as above)

<p>
Spousal loans are great for income-splitting and tax reduction in a household where you and your mate earn widely differing amounts. By making the less-taxed person the investor, more of the gains can be kept, so loaning that partner money makes sense. The loan rate has to be at least 2% (the current CRA level) with interest paid annually, added to the taxable income of the lending spouse. The costs are deductible, however, in the hands of the borrower. There will be no attribution of investment gains back to the lender – which is the whole point of this exercise.
</p>

<p>
So if there’s an income disparity in your house, Curtis, you should stop co-mingling your net incomes, pay all of the household expenses yourself then loan her a pile of cash for a non-reg account. And, of course,  be a model husband. That may involve flowers and manners. Be prepared.

It&#039;s uhh…complicated. Basic reason to care is that for some strange reason, the “income” for these benefits that you receive from your company is counted in your W2 as income, but is <strong>not</strong> reported as an adjusted basis in your official 1099-B documents. So you&#039;re double-taxed on that money, first on the W2 income and then on that income as short/long-term capital gains unless you do something about it!

It&#039;s weird, because on e-trade it knows about the adjusted basis! But for some reason, they don&#039;t report it that way on 1099-B!

Has anyone here opened a donor-advised fund (DAF)?  I just learned about DAFs, but they seem like a no-brainer for anyone who does any regular charitable giving.  My main interest would be in the ability to transfer in highly appreciated assets (such as old Intel stock with cost basis in the teens), liquidate them tax-free (!), make donations in cash (since many smaller non-profits can&#039;t receive stock donations), and take a deduction for the full current asset value.</td><td class="col4"> Untaxed. Pays you out of the trust &gt;5%, gives remainder on death to charity. <br/>
Seems kinda a way to get out of high windfall taxes and spread out income but stick a charity label on it as you can deplete it before death. Weird <br/>

<strong>Cool with it</strong>
</p>

<p>
The federal income tax is a pay-as-you-go tax. You must pay the tax as you earn or receive income during the year. There are two ways to pay as you go. Withholding and Estimated tax. If you don’t pay your tax
tax that way, you might have to pay estimated
tax. People who are in business for
themselves generally will have to pay their
tax this way. You may have to pay estimated
tax if you receive income such as dividends,
interest, capital gains, rents, and
royalties. Estimated tax is used to pay not
only income tax, but other taxes such as
self-employment tax and alternative minimum
tax.
</p>

<p>
In general, you may owe a penalty for 2017 if
the total of your withholding and timely estimated
tax payments didn’t equal at least the
smaller of:
1. 90% of your 2017 tax, or
2. 100% of your 2016 tax. (Your 2016 tax return
must cover a 12-month period.)
</p>

<p>
Minimum required each period. You will owe a penalty for any 2017 payment period for which your estimated tax payment plus your withholding for the period and overpayments applied from previous periods was less than the
smaller of:
1. 22.5% of your 2017 tax
2. 25% of your 2016 tax. (Your 2016 tax return
must cover a 12-month period.)

I just talked to Fidelity today about after-tax conversion.  They told me I have 2 choices. 
One is in-plan conversion from after tax to Roth, the money will still be under my 401K savings plan but just show as Roth, and I will have to choose from core investment options.  After my call, Fidelity will automatically convert my after-tax to Roth each time they received my contribution. 
</p>

<p>
Another choice is to roll over my after-tax to another Roth IRA, then I have more investment options.  The roll over can&#039;t be set to happen automatically, I will have to call each time I received a paycheck with after-tax deductions, but there&#039;s no limit on how many times and how much per year I can roll over my after-tax.
</p>

<p>
I was also told if I do in-plan conversion, I will not be able to withdraw from converted Roth money before 59.5 years old and while I am still working.  If I do roll over, I can withdraw from converted Roth money early, but may have penalties and tax consequences.

Nolan,
</p>

<p>
Your 401k contributions will automatically be stopped when you hit the IRS limit ($19,500 in your case). You will not need to change any elections for this to take place.
</p>

<p>
What will not stop is the after-tax contribution.
</p>

<p>
The IRS maximum of all contributions combined (401k + Intel match + after-tax) is $57,000 for 2020.
</p>

<p>
You will need to figure out how much you will be able to contribute to after-tax without going over that limit.
</p>

<p>
If you are trying to contribute to pre-tax 401k up to $19,500 max and then start contributing to after-tax, you will need to adjust your after-tax contribution % once you hit the pre-tax max.
</p>

<p>
Using a hypothetical eligible earnings of $150,000, you would be able to contribute $57,000 - $19,500 - $7,500 = $30,000 in after-tax money.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps.
</p>

<p>
Good question! The exact information needed to determine how much after-tax contributions you can make will not be available until after the plan year ends (primarily due to the 401(k) match true-up), so estimates are required. After-tax contributions will be stopped at the IRS annual additions limit ($56,000, or $62,000 if age 50+ for 2019) if the sum of your year-to-date pre-tax/Roth contributions, the year-to-date pay-period 401(k) match, and your year-to-date after-tax contributions reach that limit during the plan year.  Your pre-tax/Roth 401(k) contributions and the applicable pay-period 401(k) match will continue until you have reach IRS limits for those items ($19,000, or $25,000 if age 50+ for 2019 for your pre-tax/Roth 401(k) contributions).  If it is determined after the match true-up is calculated that contributions were made in excess of the IRS annual additions limit, there is an annual process to refund the excess amounts. You should also be aware that non-discrimination testing could result in a reduction of permissible after-tax contributions.  If this happens, excess amounts will be refunded.
</p>

<p>
To estimate your potential after-tax contribution maximum, you need to start with the IRS annual additions limit (above) and subtract your anticipated pre-tax/after tax contributions (max $19,000, or $25,000 if age 50+ for 2019), estimated match (maximum 2:1 on pre-tax/Roth contributions up to 5% of eligible pay). What is left is your estimated potential after-tax contribution. Because your regular pay and/or bonus exact amounts are not known in advance, your after-tax deferral election for regular pay and/or bonus requires you to make your best estimate.  If you have a financial advisor, consider engaging them to help with your estimate.

<p>
If you have 401K at work <strong>NOLAN DOES!</strong>, and you make more than $71K <strong>net! (after taxes, screwed that one up)</strong>, you can&#039;t deduct taxes on traditional IRA. However, you can fund a Roth IRA still. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits" class="urlextern" title="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits" rel="ugc nofollow">IRS source</a>.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, you can contribute “post-tax” to a 401K in excess of the 18K limit, up to a $50K+ limit. However, your employers plan must support it, which mine doesn&#039;t.

Bogleheads wiki page is great for this. 
</p>

<p>
If your retirement tax bracket will be lower than when working, then traditional will probably win, especially if you are not maxing out your IRA/401K. If you are maxing out your IRA/401k, then you need to take into account the leftover money that now needs to go into a taxable account to grow, where each transaction/dividend is taxed according to some rules. (basically, contradictory to below, it&#039;s not 0% taxes for leftover money).

<p>
Not necessarily the best idea to pay $2K in taxes to gain $1K in brokerage opening fees, but I do get some capital losses on the way back down…
</p>

<p>
Vanguard:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> $858 in LTCG in May/August 2019. <strong>Pay with $128 in witholdings</strong> (to spread out evenly throughout year)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> $7329.2 in LTCG in Nov 2019. $1099.38, pay via estimated taxes.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
M1 Finance:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> $2314.27 in LTCG in Nov 2019. $347.15</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> $55.24 in net STCG, at 40% marginal tax = $22.10</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
$9643 in Nov 2019 LTCG. For Fed at 15% it&#039;s $1446, for OR it&#039;s 9.9% income tax so: $954. Both are DONE!
</p>

<p>
Checking account signup bonuses:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Q3 Wells Fargo: $400</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Q3 US Bank: $300</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Q3 HSBC: $200</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Q4 Chase: $600</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Q4 Discover: $150</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Pay Q3 with withholding ($900 * .4 = $360). DONE!
Pay Q4 with CC: ($750 * .4 = $300). DONE!
</p>

<p>
<em> Technically .4 amount includes federal and state income tax and done the same below, but whatevs.</em>
</p>

<p>
Setting Federal withholdings in december 1 to be 10. Used to be 28, need 12 minimum delta for $500 bi-weekly withholding according to <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-refund/fatten-your-paycheck-and-still-get-a-tax-refund/L5HaySdDP" class="urlextern" title="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-refund/fatten-your-paycheck-and-still-get-a-tax-refund/L5HaySdDP" rel="ugc nofollow">https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-refund/fatten-your-paycheck-and-still-get-a-tax-refund/L5HaySdDP</a>. So only technically need 16, but going to 10 in case things are off.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Setting state from 38 to 10 as well. Would rather overdo rather than underdo.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> $285.65 withheld on Dec 15 for Federal. Do once more, that should be good.</div>

79293, 15334 * .9 = 13800 - 8461.62 = $5.35K ouch, should be $3750. Did I underpay federal?? Better calculate 2018 obligation and go for 90% of it. I hope not…

79612, 6929. * 1 = 6929 - 4784 = $2200. Also less than $1750, hmm. Calculate Oregon.

$1250 to Kickstart. $750*2 for bills, gifts and expenses…$300? = $3K + $5.5K for taxes = $8.5K, which requires 3 paychecks of $3300 each. Leaves buffer of $1.4K, should be fine investing November 1st paycheck in the market dip.

<p>
If you have stock options be sure to report on your schedule D for capital gains that the 1099 from the brokerage firm which handles the stock options is NOT accurate. Brokerage firms are now NOT allowed to report a cost basis for your stock option which includes a correction for the amount of the option that is reported as income. Even though it is reported on your W-2 that you have income from stock options (look at box 12), the IRS ignores this information and looks only at the uncorrected 1099. Hence unless you make it explicitly clear in your return they will count twice the income you made from the stock option and send you a rather large bill which reflects this error
