I am a 26 year old with zero investing knowledge who read Patrick&#039;s book about a year ago. The book was a great read and inspired me to learn more about investing. By the end of the book I was completely sold on Patrick&#039;s strategy, as everything he said made sense, seemed credible, and most importantly seemed attainable for a young first time investor with a relatively small income. Seemed straight forward: save about 10% of your income to invest and follow the buy/sell rules diligently. Not so easy. First I realized that being Canadian was a major setback as being an individual investor means large fees for international stocks. Next and most importantly I found that the only way to follow Patrick&#039;s screen was to join the AAII where he mentioned the screen would be posted. After joining I found that his screen has not been posted as one of the site&#039;s stock screens. Instead the only way to follow the screen is to subscribe to Stock Investor Pro, an additional $200 over the $50 annual membership fee. Kind of daunting when the comments on implementing the strategy in Stock Investor Pro make it seem much less accessible than Patrick makes it sound in his book. All in all I learned a great deal from the book, but am very disappointed with how difficult implementing the seemingly simple strategy has proven. I have searched the internet (including the forums of this site) for any info on people who have successfully implemented the strategy and have only found more frustrated millennials. I&#039;m left wondering if the whole book wasn&#039;t just an advertisement for Stock Investor Pro… If anyone has had the opposite experience, I would love to hear about it…

Perfect for automating allocating incoming money and “force” rebalancing if you so choose <a href="https://support.m1finance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001379367-How-M1-Finance-Trades" class="urlextern" title="https://support.m1finance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001379367-How-M1-Finance-Trades" rel="ugc nofollow">https://support.m1finance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001379367-How-M1-Finance-Trades</a>. Also free transactions, fractional shares, 3.5% loan on 35% of your capital, and can probably api it to get non-dividend stocks to some extent (<a href="https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/05/30/idea-for-a-new-etf/" class="urlextern" title="https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/05/30/idea-for-a-new-etf/" rel="ugc nofollow">https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/05/30/idea-for-a-new-etf/</a>).

Probably can&#039;t transfer VTSAX into it without incurring capital gains, so maybe wait when you&#039;re going to sell stuff and try it out with some new money?

“Tax minimization” strategy: 
</p>
<blockquote  class="blockquote-plugin">
<p>
In contrast, the M1 tax minimization feature aims to automatically make choices that will help you tax-wise when sales are part of rebalance.  For example, they will sell shares that have a loss first, shares that have a long-term gain second, and shares that have a short-term gain last.
</p>

</blockquote><ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Good test would be to sell something that&#039;s gone down and make sure that they register a taxable event on the books, and that it&#039;s ….</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Maybe think about it a little first, then call up their support and make sure they&#039;re doing the right thing. Don&#039;t want a wash sale, etc.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You can now sell parts of pies individually. Not sure why you&#039;d want to do that though. Maybe to force the tax loss harvesting. Rebalancing will do the same thing basically.</div>

Likely won&#039;t do <strong>capital gains harvesting</strong> (selling only large capital gains lots while in 0% tax bracket to raise tax basis): <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_gain_harvesting" class="urlextern" title="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_gain_harvesting" rel="ugc nofollow">https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_gain_harvesting</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Why only the large capital gains ones? I don&#039;t think it matters what they are as only the capital gains will be counted as you already paid taxes on them initially so they aren&#039;t counted as income</div>

Transfer account from Vanguard using an in-kind transfer. Out of vanguard is free and coming into M1 is free and supposedly keeps tax lots. However, does VTSAX (mutual fund) transfer to a mutual fund in M1? <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/blog/transfer-stocks-between-brokerages/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.m1finance.com/blog/transfer-stocks-between-brokerages/" rel="ugc nofollow">https://www.m1finance.com/blog/transfer-stocks-between-brokerages/</a>
</p>

<p>
Main thought is whether it’s worth splitting VTSAX up. And 2,

<p>
Also Apex is providing the backend to just about every thingy out there (Robinhood, betterment, etc).
