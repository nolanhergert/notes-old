UD: No I don&#039;t! It hurts and is pointless!

FL: Hmmm, it helps you avoid muscle strain when doing intense activities and it further strains your muscles so that they heal properly. But, you shouldn&#039;t stretch without exercise, that&#039;s kind of pointless!
USD: Oh, weird! Wait, why is it pointless? 
FL: Your muscles aren&#039;t able to stretch to their full potential and break their connections. For some reason, exercising beforehand helps them. 
USD: Ok, interesting. I should read more on Wikipedia about it. But, how much exercise should I do?
FL: I like exercising all the time!
USD: Oh...wow, why is that?
FL: I feel great during and afterwards, even though I&#039;m tired. Plus I have to for my job!
USD: Sounds helpful. But what if it isn&#039;t your job? I feel great doing other things too!
FL: Well, you have to take it seriously if you want any results! &lt;she&#039;s the only one in the room with skinny pants and a tighter shirt&gt; 
USD: ...
USD: &lt;what&#039;s a good question here?&gt; &lt;Hopefully FL will try to answer&gt; 
USD: &lt;he&#039;s trying to get at the answer to: How much benefit will I get from exercising / stretching relative to other activities like playing video games or surfing&gt;
FL: &lt;she seems pretty clueless as to why people don&#039;t want to look all trim. Plus she hasn&#039;t really studied body exercise from a brain exerciser&#039;s perspective, she&#039;s only needed to know it body exercise from the fact that it keeps her employed and less looked down upon than fat people!&gt;</pre>

Reading through book. Interesting thoughts:

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Common in the US is to work on your weakest areas, overcome large obstacles, etc. Why not improve the things you are gifted at and enjoy the most? </div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Maybe shouldn&#039;t apply to TAG students at schools. Not sure.</div>
</li>
</ul>

Gifts are not focus or discipline. I would sort of agree with that, but also agree too.

Strongly Describes Me	 	Neutral	 	Strongly Describes Me
				
I organize ... I analyze. //Same thing?!!//

I relate to others better when I find their weakness.		I can relate to others better when I know their goal

I like to listen, only when something good is being said. Otherwise, don&#039;t care.

I like to talk.		I like to think. //Both and//

When going gets tough, I can only trust myself. Can&#039;t trust others.....

I don&#039;t really want friends right now. I want good sources of information.

I have a bad sense of money. Generous, yet also thrifty.

I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s that important to give out praise...yet!

I enjoy philosophical discussions.		I enjoy goal-setting conferences.

I visualize the future.		I understand what caused the present circumstances.

Don&#039;t like athletic events!

Hat being controllled ... avoid feelings of emptiness!??!

I stengthen more than encourage.

Do I steal?!?! &gt;-&lt;

I seem to always have some discontentment with life.

It is easy for me to start new tasks.		My problem is getting projects finished. //Same thing??//

Want to switch projects often. 1 hour max for deep focus.

I prefer intellectual conversations ... I prefer sports?!?! (what about dance, other activiteis etc.)

love to read.		I like to figure out how things work. //Same thing//

My mind is always going .. I need to be physically active.

Lectures ... discussion groups //&gt;.&lt;//

never stop absorbing information.		I have a gift for simplifying complexities

5 hours alone thinking ...  meet with people. //Depends!//


I don&#039;t have Focus or Discipline talents :-|


**Deadlines are interesting motivators**. You basically can&#039;t trust yourself to get it done on time.

When the going gets hard, I really only trust myself right now. Maybe because I have few people that I actually trust around me.

Why the split of two? Some are neither, some are both for me.
