<p>
Permanent goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Optimize the marginal pleasure and money curve. Mr. Money Mustache&#039;s example of 2 parents and 1 child for &lt;$25K (not including mortgage/rent) seems reasonable. I&#039;m basically there already with a &lt;$15K yearly spend. Have to work on the happy part though :) </div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> With the leftover money, invest it wisely into my own financial independence and good causes. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Not so much optimize for happiness, but optimize for sustainable … impact? Man… what is The Good. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Medium-term (5 year) goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Become settled in who the God of the Universe is and what Good is.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> With that foundation set, call up Julia or someone similar and probably get married. Maybe invest in a house, maybe not. Probably dedicate 20 years of my life to raising children. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Get a better idea of what to do with my life once in a position of financial independence. </div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Not “shrivel up and die”</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Not be stuck in an apartment/house alone.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> It might be even best to stay working at technology companies for a time. Some technology can have impact.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I like the idea of asset allocation for better returns due to independent volatility. However, if there&#039;s no volatility, it can be better to just go with cap-weighted…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I still emotionally like market timing the coming recession and upturn, despite some nice videos and articles to the contrary. When to “get back in” is a toughie…I would like convincing out of my emotions if justified…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> What is Jeffrey&#039;s budget for his family? What does he optimize for?</div>

Hello Aaron,
</p>

<p>
I am enjoying your book so far! I have plenty more to read…
</p>

<p>
However, after thinking about the example in Chapter 1 [1] (link to Google Books), I think your derivation of the expected return is incorrect. Let&#039;s run the idealized scenario of N = 250, 125 heads and 125 tails. We would expect the expected value to reflect this idealized scenario accurately, correct?
</p>

<p>
With the 20% / -18% return scenario, the expected value would be:
1.20^(125)*(1-0.18)^(125) = 0.984^125 = $.133. As expected from the trials. 
</p>

<p>
With another scenario, a static dollar $.20 / $-.18 return, where the pot doesn&#039;t change:
$.20*125 - $.18*125 + 1 = $3.50 
</p>

<p>
But this isn&#039;t the same as the expected value ….? 1.01^250 = $12.03!
</p>

<p>
I&#039;m confused now…
</p>

Good book also by Howard Marks, although a little too high level for me.
</p>

<p>
Their goal isn&#039;t to outrun the winners, just matching the index is fine. However, they want to avoid all the downside recession risk that comes with the index. Sounds good to me.
</p>

<p>
Determining whether an investor is skilled (alpha) is not so easily determined after the fact! There were many other possible outcomes that could have but didn&#039;t happen. Did they just leverage up and take on more volatility/risk (beta)?
</p>

<p>
Also, investors that are bullish will look good in bullish markets, and look really bad in down markets. Same for vice versa. Just because someone calls the top doesn&#039;t mean they didn&#039;t have many false alarms before then.

Finally, risk. Not only does leverage wildly exaggerate risk in any falling market, but the danger of putting all your net worth in one bucket these days is extreme. Real estate’s a sitting duck for more government taxation as it becomes a symbol of wealth (look at BC). Housing also turns illiquid when the market sours. Financial assets, in contrast, can be sold in seconds. The last thing you want going into retirement is a paid-off home that can’t be turned into cash flow to live on. So a one-asset plan’s a total crap shoot on what conditions may be when that holding must be punted.

Which is lower than I expected (isn&#039;t it 7% real average total returns for stock market?, but doesn&#039;t include cash returns which isn&#039;t zero generally).

<p>
Another question! I claimed to write a program a while back for you that allowed people to get some knobs in working with the historical returns / Safe Withdrawal Rate data. While for short periods of investment time it&#039;s quite illuminating (and I should finish it just for that), one reason I lost some motivation to do it is because for long-term investing you have some evidence showing one can have hope of timing the business cycle market downturns/upturns!
</p>

<p>
Don&#039;t the market indicators severely lessen the relevance of the hands-off approaches to the SWR calculations (in a good way)? There are interesting bits to be sure, but in practice we can do better than that and making a full-blown calculator I still am digesting the still-helpful learnings from your simulations, but surely you aren&#039;t recommending shouldn&#039;t it be more like a 4 or 5% rule again?
</p>

<p>
Also, I&#039;m curious on your opinion on using options to amplify the returns from knowing that market downturns/upturns are coming instead of just adjusting your asset allocation.

For investors who have the <strong>time and inclination</strong> to research stocks, he&#039;d recommend it. It can pay off!
</p>

<p>
If thousands of mutual fund managers and professional stock pickers with way more information, access, money, computers etc can&#039;t beat the index, what possible chance does an individual retail investor have? Yet, they are at a huge disadvantage?! <strong>Nice hook dude</strong>
</p>

<p>
MM (Money Managers) have different goals
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> They are most served by increasing their NAV and not decreasing it. So, they tend to buy IBMs and larger companies. Small companies make hardly a dent in their returns, and they affect the stock price too much.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> For some reason, their investors will pull out of the fund <strong>that week/month/quarter</strong> if they under-perform the s&amp;p 500 with any significance. Hands are tied, kinda.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Ppl add money when it&#039;s going up, and withdraw money when it&#039;s going down.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
No reimbursement fees. Also they&#039;re paid to get more NAV, not for returns.
</p>

<p>
Retail investors can go for the long term.
</p>

<p>
Advocates fundamental analysis of a stock over time, with a good amount of up front work to find the best potential companies. Do <strong>not</strong> look at the stock values over time as an investment decision, rather look at the fundamentals and add appropriately over time.
</p>

<p>
His personal returns over last 5 years were 155% vs. s&amp;p 500 of 125%. Doesn&#039;t look that big (31% cagr vs. 25% cagr), but it adds up over time.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that 2/3 of Russell 3000 are losers, and 7% make up the winners / gains. So to match the market, 1/2 will be losers, 4/10 will do ok, and 1/10 will be a home run.
</p>

<p>
Wall Street tends to think for the next quarter. Volcanoes in Iceland affects Iceland air travel company short-term but shouldn&#039;t crater their stock. Same for subscribers flat for Netflix because of splitting their service, but neither really affected the long term business plan. Great buying opportunities.
</p>

<p>
Really likes stay-cations, especially with kids. Go to a hotel nearby with a heated pool. Experience something different, very cheaply! 
</p>

<p>
Also feels connecting with local community (sports coach…some other examples) brings a ton of benefits. You&#039;d think just doing the things you&#039;re really passionate about will be great, but it&#039;s insular. There&#039;s a lot more to the world to see!

been tried, even in persistent attempts to get out of debt, it has eventually been
abandoned by all governments because it didn’t work, and it was too painful.
That is because the decreased borrowing and spending (and consequences of
these on employment and many other pain points) make this type of deleveraging
as self-reinforcing on the downside as the increased debts and spending
that cause bubbles is on the upside.

But if you must, buy year long puts (leaps) on SPY or other heavily traded index fund ETFs. Go deep in the money, and the payout starts to look enough like short selling for most people’s needs.

I usually find options superior to inverse ETFs, and it gets you around the restrictions against short selling and/or margin.

The best possible outcome from the publication of Flash Boys would not be a series of insider-trading prosecutions. Rather, it would be a decision made at the highest levels of banks like Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse: If our clients want us to route their orders through IEX, then we’ll route their orders through IEX. That would involve the banks giving up precious revenue of their own, from their dark pools and the other methods by which they extract rents from high-frequency traders. But it would give Katsuyama the opportunity to prove his case, once and for all, that his technology really does give big investors much better execution.
</p>

<p>
If all went according to plan, the result would be less money for high-frequency traders, and more money for mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge fund billionaires, and other big investors. Small investors would, realistically, see no difference at all. But most importantly, the market as a whole would be less skittish, less brittle, more robust. IEX, if it works, might just be the technology which could prevent a catastrophic global Flash Crash II.

Sometimes—not often, but sometimes—I used options to either buy a stock by selling puts. Less often I used covered calls to generate additional income. These strategies are a double edged sword. A naked put might bring in additional revenue, but if the stock climbs higher your resources would have been better utilized owning the stock rather than getting cute in an attempt to pull an extra thousand or so in option premiums. Covered calls had the opposite problem. Sometimes a stock runs too far, too fast. But trying to figure out a top is nothing short of insanity. Covered calls can work, but you risk the stock climbing over the strike price.

Great introduction into why index funds match the average actively invested dollar. TODO write summary for review and understanding.
</p>

<p>
For a total market fund (u.s. funds I guess, might want to branch out into international too) It automatically beats 50% of the market because only &lt;actively managed&gt; mutual funds are generally in the market and buying / selling and changing the stock price. 
</p>

<p>
“The S&amp;P 500 or Total Market Index Fund basically only track the top few 10s of companies (generally large growth) in the stock exchange because of their huge market capitalization relative to others”

For example, imagine that the active manager was information driven but cheap and free of human biases - like an algorithm that did analysis of a stock and valued in on just two factors: predicted dividend flow over the long term, and impact of passive investing flows on the price of the stock based on knowledge of the index and the overall pattern of cash flows in and out of the market. This should win over the passive guys in average - it uses 2 decent data points: one pertaining to actual income from the company and one pertaining to predictable market forces - while passive uses no data points. And the cost at the end of the day should be roughly similar.

This is what I always come back to. I could spend every waking hour of my free time doing this type of research, and likely beat my current positions by a few percentage points. Or, I could put that same effort into being the best engineer/manager I could be, and likely have much, much more capital to invest in the first place. It&#039;s a matter of efficiency.

I like researching investments as a hobby. If I thought it was boring or tedious to pore through SEC filings I&#039;d stick to 100% index funds.
</p>

<p>
You make a really good point though, and one that more people need to understand. You&#039;re almost always better off spending your time to improve your financial situation (save more money, get a raise, get a new job, etc) than you are trying to find an investment that&#039;ll provide a higher return.

<p>
The unintended consequences of those new regulations introduced as a result of the GFC, which
have largely removed the market making role of investment banks from global equity markets,
has coincided with the recent massive increase in market share of both ‘dumb’ index funds and
‘black box’ algorithmic funds to create a situation where equity market volumes have fallen
sharply and individual stock volatility has risen dramatically. An initially badly executed order can
now inadvertently create a price trend (because there is no longer the cushion to price moves
which was in the past provided by market maker inventories) that, as algorithmic funds feast on
it, can create a market event even if the initial order was a simple innocent error. Truly – to mix
metaphors – butterflies flapping their wings now regularly create hurricanes that stop out
fundamentally driven investors who cannot remain <strong>solvent</strong> longer than the market can remain
irrational.

And the reason I know this is because <strong>I know a lot of people that are financially independent that are 100% miserable</strong>. They’re lonely, they’re anxious, they’re fearful… but they’re free. Financial independence is not the end goal; <strong>happiness</strong> is the end goal. So we need to always keep that in mind. We just need to internalize that message. Happiness leads to freedom.

And to be honest, it’s not that expensive to become happy. When you can cultivate happiness in your life with really simple things that I write about like gratitude, getting rid of negatives from your life, decluttering all the physical things you don’t need, the mental baggage and the obligation—like I said, stop watching the news, just walk and meditate—those things don’t cost anything, but they’ll make you happy.
Happiness is freedom. You have to practice. It’s a skill. Happiness is definitely a skill. It’s not something that we just blunder into for the most part.

Early retirement is a mirage when you’re physically and mentally capable of doing more. Humans are generally not built to derive sustainable happiness from sipping mojitos on a picturesque island somewhere in the pacific. Once you’ve tasted the sweetness of a dedicated purpose, it’s near impossible to be content just sitting on the sidelines.

Q: Would you ever quit your day job and devote all your time to bigger / longer YouTube projects? Is that even feasible?
</p>

<p>
A: No. I&#039;m actually pretty sucky at managing my time so if I had all day to work on projects I&#039;m afraid I would mostly just hang out on TMZ.com. I find I&#039;m much more productive when I&#039;m constrained. Plus I like keeping the YouTube thing as a hobby and not as a primary thing for me psychologically. Coming up with ideas and creativity is such a delicate thing and I try to protect it like a little candle flame. Plus I really like my coworkers and our lunchtime conversations and the work we&#039;re doing. Financially, YouTube is more of a significant part of our family revenue but I just really love the balance we&#039;ve got atm and chasing the money often seems to lead to inauthenticity imho.

A nice excerpt of an idealized view of Financial Independence from Mr. Money Mustache. I reference it because I expect my “goal markers” to change over time and it feels weird to pin it down to something. However, I do know that not everyone has MMM&#039;s drive to do something productive every day but instead hates themselves when they drag around all day philosophizing of what they *should* be doing :) 
</p>

<p>
<em>I also struggle with laziness and worry that I’m wasting my lucky place in the universe. My advice to people who are striving is to be sure to have a clear idea of what you want your life to be post-retirement. Have lists of things you want to do and accomplish because if you’re the type of person who has the discipline to retire early, you’re probably the type of person who won’t be happy as a couch potato.</em>

Pete&#039;s excerpt:
</p>

<p>
What if work were something that you did only when it worked for you? If you could go at it with gusto on certain days, or even certain seasons or years, but then shift to other things for a while when your priorities changed? You might spend most of your 20s burning up the corporate ladder or being the workhorse that keeps a startup company in the black. But then your 30s might be mostly consumed by bringing up young children, your 40s might see you starting more companies or reclaiming your youth as a touring rocker, and your 50s and 60s are yet to be charted. Now that I&#039;ve met a large number people who have actually followed this path, I can see that financial independence isn&#039;t so much about freedom from work. It is more about freedom to do your best work, without money getting in the way.
</p>

<p>
This is what I&#039;m really describing when I talk about early retirement. It&#039;s not really retirement at all, but that&#039;s because I don&#039;t think anybody should truly retire in the old sense of the word — swearing off all forms of paid activity in favor of a dramatic increase in television watching and golf playing. Creation of new ideas, new enterprises, or new things is the biggest joy of being alive. Learning more about life, the world, and yourself and then trying to mix the ingredients together to the best of your ability is the happiest path you can take as a human. We&#039;re uniquely lucky to even have such an option available to us these days.
</p>

<p>
So in my own case I started just with the goal of being a parent, but then ended up starting a house-building company to pursue my lifelong love of building things. Then I learned that the daily stress and schedule of big, multi-person projects was still too much for me at the time, so it evolved into a boutique carpentry operation that still does local projects to this day.  Other ventures have come and gone, but none of them were done because we needed the money. That is my definition of a modern retirement: the activities you pursue once you are done searching for money.
</p>

<p>
Like an old-time homesteader, I enjoy learning new skills as the opportunity comes up, because I find it&#039;s more satisfying to learn something than to outsource it to others, even if you can afford it. Housekeeping and haircutting, cooking and gardening, but also welding and plumbing, framing and roofing, heating and cooling, auto repair and strength training, drum playing and electronic dance music composition and beer brewing are just a few of the things I have had the joy of working on in this first decade of retirement.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in there I also started a blog with the goal of reducing the rich world&#039;s resource consumption while suggesting that we could all have a lot more fun in the process. It was done mostly on a whim and only possible due to the free time available in the absence of a real job. But even this side gig has blown up into something much more fun than my original work career and is in fact what has brought you and me together at this very moment.

I am making a lot of money and able to do things with it, maybe even be financially independent / retire early and living off of the hard work of others. A few things worry me, and nothing other than greed excites me:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> So I have $20K sitting in my bank account, depreciating, costing <strong>$100/month in opportunity cost</strong>.

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If everyone did what I am doing, basically only trusting myself and studying to be a semi-expert in everything, no one would have time/energy to specialize!

Indeed, rentals can beat the market, but with both more risk and more work required.  You should put this thread in the Real Estate forum, I believe they&#039;d cut down a lot of your assumptions regarding maintenance, home appreciation, vacancy, how to calculate projected income (I think they use a 50%-75% rule), taxes, and transaction costs.  Also, as Northerly mentioned, you&#039;re comparing <strong>owning 20,000 companies worldwide with 0 leverage, to owning a single home, in a single country/state/city/town/neighborhood, with something like 400-500% leverage.

using index funds *for bonds* is absurd (not even any theoretical justification, but, think of it in common sense terms: it means you want to lend more money to the entities incurring the biggest debts — lend more and more to wastrels who keep getting deeper in debt — how does that make any sense at all?!).

To understand heartbeats, it helps to know that they’re just a supersize version of something ETFs do every day. ETFs are funds whose shares trade all day on stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs aren’t sold directly to regular investors. Instead, they use banks and brokerage firms as middlemen. These large traders don’t transact in cash. They make an ETF bigger or smaller by adding portfolio stocks to it, or by taking them out. They call this activity “creating” and “redeeming” ETF shares. (All this is invisible to small investors, who just buy ETFs from brokers.)
</p>

<p>
Enter the Nixon-era tax law. In 1969, Congress decreed that mutual funds can hand over appreciated stocks to withdrawing investors without triggering a tax bill. Lawmakers never explained why they blessed the industry with this unique break, but back then, it didn’t seem like much of a giveaway. Mutual funds rarely took advantage of it, because their investors preferred cash payouts.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to 1993, when American Stock Exchange executives devising the first U.S. exchange-traded fundrealized they could put that old tax rule to a new use. Say an ETF needs to get rid of a stock that went up. Selling it would trigger a taxable gain that would ultimately be paid by fund investors. But handing the stock off to a broker who’s making a withdrawal achieves the same goal, tax-free. Every time a broker redeems a stake in a fund, it’s another chance to avoid taxes. That loophole gives ETFs a tax advantage over mutual funds. It went from a footnote in the tax code to the cornerstone of a new industry.

However, if you do quicksale, you don&#039;t get the benefit of “long-term capital gains tax”, which is less than the “short-term capital gains tax”/ disqualifying disposition. <strong>Have to wait 1 year</strong> <a href="0media/everyday/stock_purchase_plan_spp_tax_treatment.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="everyday:stock_purchase_plan_spp_tax_treatment.pdf">stock_purchase_plan_spp_tax_treatment.pdf</a>

<h5 id="disqualifying_vs_qualifying_dispositions">Disqualifying vs Qualifying Dispositions</h5>

<p>
This is the main difference. Have to wait 2 years for qualified dispositions, independent of short or long term capital gains taxes.

The formula on wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator">Amortization_calculator</a> doesn&#039;t work for me! For:
</p>
<pre class="code">A = 1200 / month
P = _____ (solve for this)
I = .035
N = 12*15 = 180

P = A / (I + I / ((1+I)^N - 1)) = $34215.59??? The website I tried says this too.

Going the normal way, P should be ~ $167,000. </pre>
