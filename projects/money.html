An update:

Thinking about religion things. Sorta complicated topic!

Unfortunately, money is an easier topic to make progress on. Some uncommon favorites of mine:

Your time to financial independence / retirement can be derived from only your savings rate! 
</p>

<p>
Depending on the situation, not getting seemingly insignificant luxuries like a new car + collision insurance, cable tv, or the frequent latte could save you from <strong>years</strong> of working!
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> And I should clarify. It&#039;s not that you don&#039;t have a car or entertainment or lattes, it&#039;s that you see how much marginal utility they are giving you relative to their cheaper alternatives, such as a <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/11/28/new-cars-and-auto-financing-stupid-or-sensible/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/11/28/new-cars-and-auto-financing-stupid-or-sensible/" rel="ugc nofollow">$10K used car</a>, netflix or walking and talking with people, and making that delicious latte yourself at home!</div>

This leads to interesting questions like: <strong>“Do I really want to trade &lt;X&gt; weeks/years of my life for &lt;Y&gt;“</strong>?

<div class="level2">

<p>
The process of opening credit card accounts for the sole purpose of getting the signup bonuses, and then moving onto the next credit card. 
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/009-travel-rewards-travel-world-free-ultimate-guide/" class="urlextern" title="https://www.choosefi.com/009-travel-rewards-travel-world-free-ultimate-guide/" rel="ugc nofollow">https://www.choosefi.com/009-travel-rewards-travel-world-free-ultimate-guide/</a> for a great intro, summarized below with extra notes by me:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Will hurt a perfect 850 credit score, but from what I read as long as you stay above ~760 (easy to do) it looks like banks don&#039;t care for determining your mortgage rate. However, one should double check this (I haven&#039;t) and stop churning well ahead of time if needed.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Keep your old cards! Average Age of Accounts seems my biggest barrier to getting past 780. One might consider starting teenagers with building their credit score on a secured card (kind of like a debit card). It&#039;s a difficult tradeoff between opening the door to debt/impulse spending and improving your mortgage rates and signup bonus opportunities in the far future.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It is untaxed because it&#039;s counted as a “coupon” for purchases you made.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Takes a few hours of research at the beginning to learn about the process, and about 15 minutes to apply for the card. If you want to further optimize, that of course takes more time. Must be somewhat disciplined so you pay off <strong>fully</strong> every month or utilize 0% intro APR, etc.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Also make sure to read the fine print of the conditions of the spend.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> I find it easier to make the big tax payment on the signup bonus cards rather than everyday purchases as returned items often get confused with credit card payments in a spreadsheet but subtract from your minimum spend. &lt;speaking from experience!&gt;</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> &lt;Bank&gt; The first direct deposit was required to be $500, and I had done 2 bi-weekly direct deposits totaling $500 in the first month. Didn&#039;t get the signup bonus <img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="icon" alt=":-)" /></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The $500 annual fee cards with tons of travel-oriented benefits and lots of blogger buzz because of ~$100 referral commissions often have bad (1%) cash back beyond the signup bonus. You&#039;re probably better off using a different card for normal spending if you&#039;re not planning on traveling or paying the annual fee <img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="icon" alt=":-)" />. You can usually transfer the points to a lower annual fee card, but I haven&#039;t tried or looked into that yet.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You do get more for your rewards if you redeem them for travel (flights, hotels, probably not hostels though). However if you&#039;re like me and would rather take longer vacations sooner (FI), getting unused miles/rewards in cash seems worth it.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Additionally, if you&#039;re married you can apply for the cards separately and get double the card bonuses. Scores and rewards are separate, even if your expenses are joint.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> If you&#039;re a small business owner with expenses, then those can go on a special business credit card too. In addition to all the other business expense deductions one can claim.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Potential benefits are $500 tax-free cash (or more for miles) per card for $3-4K of spending in 3 months for each card, to a limit of 5 good &lt;Chase&gt; cards in 24 months, per person. Not bad, but it might not be worth your time either. <abbr title="Your mileage may vary">YMMV</abbr>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Ethics:</strong> Not sure on this one. </div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> If someone wants to give you money in the hopes that you screw up and you don&#039;t screw up, is accepting the money ok? Probably? </div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The indebted / debit / cash payers are the ones really paying for your bonus, so make a point of being thankful and giving back?</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you run out of credit cards to churn, the Federal debit card fee is only ~$2.50 for any amount. Discover has a 1% cash back debit card, and other cards have temporary promotions. Oregon has the normal 2% fee, so this isn&#039;t beneficial over just a normal EFT.</div>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> It feels weird because everyone on the mailing list got the emails about it already. But, maybe a succinct hook with a presentation will be helpful for those not motivated before.</div>

The way you tell your employer to not withhold income taxes for you is through your W4 form.
<del>  * Since writing 99 allowances would probably raise red flags, I&#039;m opting for just enough so that my withholding is $0. It turns out the answer for 2018 is simple. (Gross wages - 3700) / 4150. But here&#039;s a spreadsheet to help with that: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZtnL0C-SE4XJi9uZSjrt1-CW3u8YiJktHPyD1HXhDg/edit?usp=sharing" class="urlextern" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZtnL0C-SE4XJi9uZSjrt1-CW3u8YiJktHPyD1HXhDg/edit?usp=sharing" rel="ugc nofollow">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZtnL0C-SE4XJi9uZSjrt1-CW3u8YiJktHPyD1HXhDg/edit?usp=sharing</a></del> <em>Changed in 2019+.

If you don&#039;t have a lot of taxes to pay, you can combine 2 quarters of tax payments into a 3-month credit card window as done in the cash flow spreadsheet. Pretty clever!

Otherwise just be sure that the payment goes through in time (I saw 2 weeks ahead of time for some Federal processors).
