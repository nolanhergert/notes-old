Cache bugs are one of the fun ones. You think you&#039;re losing your mind and the people around you would probably agree. A couple of weeks go by, your spouse is ready to fire you, your boss wants to divorce you, and every waking moment is full of race conditions. Four-way stops on the drive to work are a source of stress and you punch buttons in the elevator and worry about firmware bugs. Then you get to your desk and there&#039;s the setup, a laughably small board for all the trouble it&#039;s made, and it&#039;s time for single combat, Sherlock Holmes style.
</p>

<p>
When you find the problem it&#039;s usually a blinding flash of realization that illuminates a tiny, eensy bit of code that you tweak and make right in a couple of minutes. Invariably the mistake was pretty stupid. The glory moment is over quickly because you know all the test cases will pass and that you&#039;ve just nailed another one.
</p>

<p>
You&#039;ve got bragging rights during one lunch, but that&#039;s it. It&#039;s off to more mundane bugs in the mortal world, and you feel a little sad.

The above are simple examples to try and encourage a viewpoint, that critical thinking and fact checking are very important to making solid conclusions on something. Because of the obviously highly time-intensive nature of this research, most subjects will fall by the wayside as they are not as important as others. However, sites such as Wikipedia are structured for this it can only be done on a few subjects in one&#039;s lifetime. The current state of technology doesn&#039;t allow for this yet I don&#039;t advocate that this should be done for everything
I am really annoyed when pastors give an explanation of a certain section of the Bible but lack the cross-references to other parts of the Bible to really drive home the point that I can trust them. Or, maybe we don&#039;t know the answer at all, and I want to be able to know that too! For example…the passage from young adults this week. 
Luke 22:24-27
</p>
<blockquote><div class="no">
 24 Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest. 25 And He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ 26 But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who governs as he who serves. 27 For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.</div></blockquote>

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> When I teach Christian Worldview to adult undergraduate students, I tell them that if they want a good grade from me they have to do two things on every assignment in the following order: first, understand what the author/speaker is saying. Comprehend his flow of thought well enough that you can give it back to me in your own words accurately. Then, and only then, may you move on to the next step, which is to evaluate what he is saying and agree or disagree.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Why do I make such a point of this? Because it doesn&#039;t come naturally to us. We tend to quickly get wind of where an author or speaker is going, and we immediately begin making judgments about it before we&#039;ve even heard him out. We know what we&#039;re comfortable with and we have little interest in being stretched beyond it. So we prejudge what others say before they&#039;ve even finished saying it, which is a defense mechanism of sorts in that it gives us permission to stay comfortable, and to prevent new thoughts from challenging us.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The challenge for the students is a difficult one. I issue this challenge in part to get non-Christian students to at least understand Christianity on its own terms, not just some popular misconception of it. But you know what? The Christian students in my classes are just as bad at this as everyone else. Throughout the course we look at some non-Christian worldviews too and I tell them the same thing: learn it first, fairly and accurately. Then you may respond. But this is hard for many of them to do. The moment they get wind that an idea came from somewhere other than the Bible, their brains shut down and all the emotional defenses go up.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The students who do take me up on the challenge all end up saying the same thing, whether they&#039;re Christians or not. They tell me the class was informative, challenging, and they&#039;d never thought about their beliefs in this way before. Many of them go so far as to say they weren&#039;t even aware that they could think about their beliefs this way. Because they accepted my challenge to understand first, they leave the class with a whole new set of tools to process what they believe and why. They&#039;re better people for having been stretched. For having listened.</div>

The hooker working the corner, the addict and the abuser are the ones Jesus sent us to love and preach the gospel to.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>Hello Kickstart,</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I had the pleasure in high school of talking with Martin Fisher during his award for the Lemelson Prize at MIT, oh, 6 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed keeping up with your progress and your insight into how to best provide a “hand up” for people who are stuck in poverty with no visible way out. It has helped me really see the myraid of ways I am blessed to be living in America and how useless my advanced major might be for a vast majority of people. Am I willing to move to help? Probably not yet (gotta pay off the school loans too), but it is a thought in my mind.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Anyways, I was wondering if I could help in some immediate way and follow what you guys (and other similar groups) do a little more closely. My strengths are in programming, electronic “gadget” design, and various mathematical things, but I understand that phone apps or elegant equations probably don&#039;t raise people out of poverty. I am horrible at mechanical things, although I would like to improve and am taking baby steps. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Are there some books or blogs that you recommend? Your annual report is enlightening.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Thanks!</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Hey Nolan</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I wouldn&#039;t worry about being horrible about mechanical stuff.   If that becomes part of an innovative system people can always be hired.  I&#039;m a mech eng grad, and a decade ago I might have said that real things that you can pick up and use were the really important things.  Not now though.  Years of experience and one MBA later, I&#039;m convinced that what is most important are effective systems, and communications and electronics are key parts  of that. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Here&#039;s one example.  Renewables are becoming feasible. We can put together a simple PV pump system from off-the-shelf components with no more engineering knowhow than someone who knows how to charge the battery on their car. Getting it embedded as an accepted technology by small scale farmers (which will ultimately, after payback, increase their profits) will take financing systems, and electronic/GSM systems to control periodic payments. There&#039;s no way people can pay for these systems up front.   Last week a guy resident in San Francisco showed me a device which could be used as part of this process - a small board about two inches square with one IC which will unlock solar panels if payments have been made by SMS.  </div>
