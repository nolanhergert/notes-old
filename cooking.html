Can alternatively tenderize the meat using a mallet or chemistry?! I wonder how that compares to 24 hours in a sous vide

<p>
Only the <strong>surface</strong> of meats (except for poultry apparently) has the bacteria, so you can cook the inside to whatever temperature you want then you&#039;re done!

Collagen breakdown for tough cuts can happen for long time at low temperatures, or short time at high temperatures. <a href="https://www.chefsteps.com/forum/posts/tough-shoulder-after-sous-vide" class="urlextern" title="https://www.chefsteps.com/forum/posts/tough-shoulder-after-sous-vide" rel="ugc nofollow">https://www.chefsteps.com/forum/posts/tough-shoulder-after-sous-vide</a>

Collagen fibers begin to break at above 160˚F and reach a peak rate at 180˚. It takes at least 3 hours for the collagen to convert to gelatin sufficiently to hold its form after refrigeration. The problem, though, is that collagen starts to contract at 140˚, and if there isn&#039;t sufficient fat to resist the contraction the moisture will be wrung from the meat before the collagen finishes breaking into gelatin. Contrastingly, enzyme breakdown is what sous vide does. In particular, collagenases activate at 113˚, peak at 130˚, and completely denature above 140˚. It takes a minimum of 6 hours at 130˚ for enzyme conversion of collagen into gelatin in a young animal (e.g., veal and lamb), and up to <strong>48 hours</strong> in a roast from a mature animal. And it all happens well below where the collagen can contract.

Takes about 20-30 minutes to bring a refrigerated meat to temperature.

What&#039;s helping is to add a layer of salt to outside before frying. Adds a nice “steakhouse” touch. 
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="time">Time</h4>
<div class="level4">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 14 hours is not enough on chuck steak, gives a red juice color and is not nearly melt in your mouth yet. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Maybe letting it sit in the fridge for a week was helpful. I don&#039;t think so though…</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4 id="searing">Searing</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
It&#039;s nice to get a sear on it, but honestly, it doesn&#039;t add <strong>that</strong> much to the flavor. Mostly crispy crust for texture.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Maybe add some sugars next time?</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Recommends cast iron skillet (can retain a lot of heat) searing with oil, then further finishing with hot flame like searzall. Super hot gas/coals grill works well too. Want the char without heating up the inside too much.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> (Try to get a flat cut) <del>Probably should use a cut of beef that is big and fat like a bottom round or chuck roast so</del> Won&#039;t allow for you to cut meat “across the grain” in the end, but maybe getting a sear with just a pan is worth cutting with the grain.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Dad has outside wok. Thankfully a hot gas grill is good enough too.</div>

</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Yeah, get the inside warmed up, then fry. Want to keep the crust dry, so don&#039;t keep it warm enroute to destination with a water bath in a bag. Just let it keep airing out. The inside will stay moist.</div>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Not</strong> Brisket: Unless it tenderizes by the end of today, it&#039;s pretty annoying to chew still. Big thing of fat on the outside too that you&#039;re paying to cut off.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Lean cuts (eye of loin, others), you apparently need to cook them at lower temperature so they don&#039;t toughen. But not below 130 F for more than 3 hours as bacteria <strong>grow</strong> at those temperatures and times.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> But then again, the lean cuts when warm and freshly seared, are tender perfect too. Try again another time.</div>

<h4 id="salt">Salt?</h4>

1 sugar cube = 3 grams of sugar.

I did too much salt last time, almost a full small glass bowl (3/4 cup = 225 grams) for 6 pounds of beef. 1/4 to 1/2 of that would probably be good. Need to test in separate bags as the broth will meld

Why can&#039;t we have “dimmed” stoves and crock-pots with high switching frequency?

<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> high power 2KW vs 100W light bulb</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Lots more switching noise and EMF</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Dissipates even more heat at the triac than to the pot</div>

</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Also, there&#039;s plenty of thermal mass in the glass-ceramic cooktop or the normal metal heater such that the large variation in temperatures due to ~10s switching frequency only makes a small change in the temperature at the top, not to mention the thermal mass of the heavy bottom pot + pot of <strong>water</strong> helps a ton too. </div>

On the other hand, things like corded hand drills rely on having variable speed control and are reasonably high-powered. I guess they use TRIACs! (probably because they have to).
