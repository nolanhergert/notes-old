<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The great need of our time is for people to experience the living reality of God by hearing his word personally and transformingly in Scripture.

<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <em>Different readers will doubtless find different aspects of Piper&#039;s exposition most arresting, but I came away especially provoked to meditate by his efforts to fathom two passages, which I have also pondered. One is Luke 10:21, where Jesus says that God has “hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children.” Piper&#039;s careful exegesis shows convincingly that Jesus&#039; words are meant to promote humility in the use of all gifts, including intelligence, rather than to deny the intellect. The other passage is 1 Corinthians 1:20, where the apostle Paul says that God has “made foolish the wisdom of the world.” Again, careful exegesis shows that the intent of the passage is to differentiate between wisdom used to exalt the creature and wisdom employed to honor the Creator. This conclusion is later summarized in one of Piper&#039;s many striking phrases: “The cross is the continental divide between human wisdom and divine wisdom.”</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &lt;Going into pastoral ministry is not meant to be for everyone, but is best for him&gt; It seemed to me then that these things—thinking and feeling and doing—would perhaps find a better balance in the church than in school. By “better” I mean a balance that would fit my gifts, and God’s call, and people’s needs, and the purposes of God for this world. I think I did the right thing. <strong>But I don’t mean it would be right for everybody</strong>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Thinking, without prayer, without the Holy Spirit, without obedience, without love, will puff up and destroy (1 Cor. 8:1). But thinking under the mighty hand of God, thinking soaked in prayer, thinking carried by the Holy Spirit, thinking tethered to the Bible, thinking in pursuit of more reasons to praise and proclaim the glories of God, thinking in the service of love—such thinking is indispensable in a life of fullest praise to God.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> This book promises a lot! So what I want to do in this book is take you with me into the Bible itself to see how God has ordered this act of thinking <strong>in relation to other crucial acts in life</strong>. How does it relate to our believing, and worshiping, and living in this world? Why are there so many warn- ings about “knowledge” (1 Tim. 6:20), and “the wisdom of this world” (1 Cor. 3:19), and “philosophy” (Col. 2:8), and the “debased mind” (Rom. 1:28), and “the wise and understanding” who can’t see (Luke 10:21), and those whose understanding is darkened (Eph. 4:18)?</div>

At one point these tasks were all difficult and awkward. Learning the skill and practicing it was not fun. The joy is on the other side of the hard work. This is basic to all growing up.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> This is what we saw in chapter 4. People could draw true infer- ences from morning and evening skies but would not use that same reasoning process to discern who Jesus was (Matt. 16:1–4). They wanted safety on the seas. But they did not want to know Jesus for who he was. So their minds drew true conclusions from the weather because their skin was at stake. They loved their physical safety. But they claimed to have too little evidence to know the Son of God. He was too threatening to their desires.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So what has become of the mind and its handmaid, language, here in Matthew 21:23–27? The mind has become the nimble, dodg- ing slave of the priests’ and elders’ passions. And language does the tricky work of covering up the corruption. Truth is irrelevant here in guiding what they say. It doesn’t matter whether John’s baptism is from heaven or from man. Truth does not matter. What matters is that we not be shamed and that we not be harmed. So we will use language to cover our indifference to truth and our allegiance to the gods of pride and comfort; and we will say, “We do not know.”

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Conclusion: The lesson from 1 Corinthians 8:1–3 and Romans 10:1–4 is that thinking is dangerous and indispensable. Without a profound work of grace in the heart, knowledge—the fruit of thinking—puffs up. But with that grace, thinking opens the door of humble knowledge. And that knowledge is the fuel of the fire of love for God and man. If we turn away from serious thinking in our pursuit of God, that fire will eventually go out.</div>

<div class="level3">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Conclusion: When all the cautions have been heard—especially those concerning pride—the fact remains: God has revealed himself in his Word and in his world. He means to be known through the revelation of both, because he means to be loved fully. Moreover, when the psalmist ponders the place God has given to man in the created world, he marvels, “You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet” (Ps. 8:6). Why has God done this? He did not do it to tempt us to idolatry by the beauty of what he has made. That came in with sin (Rom. 1:23). He did it because more of his glory would be known and treasured when seen through the prism of his creation.</div>
