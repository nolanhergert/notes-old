I wonder how well their arguments hold for really difficult topics, say mathematics / physics. For now I think the biggest benefit of college is being able to talk to a professor during office hours / meet with other students, which they rebut above.

<h4 id="graduation_2013">Graduation 2013</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
 I&#039;ve been thinking through this today, trying to figure out what to say. I can&#039;t fully describe it yet, but I have one of the worst kinds of regret. <br/>
I slaved over exams and long problem sets, kept my time close to my chest for some knowledge and sleep that I thought would prove to be the best. <br/>
I have settled for numerous “hello&#039;s” in the hall, and sometimes even avoiding you so that I wouldn&#039;t have to face my failure and fall. <br/>
It&#039;s easy to blame others for this transformation: my professors, the homework, the whole broken creation. <br/>
But, in the end, it was an awkward decision. <br/>
Although I attempted to reconcile to you in my head, I never once asked if you wanted to be fed. <br/>
There are many more thoughts that I wish to say here, but I must end soon and wipe away these tears. <br/>
Please help me to be less a machine and more a person, one with emotions, feelings, and cares for the next door man and woman. <br/>
Gently remind me of this in the dance called friendship, and I will quickly move to make things right once again. <br/>
Let us not be merely faces in some book that&#039;s online, but rather friends in all spaces, a relationship that&#039;s built tough over time.
