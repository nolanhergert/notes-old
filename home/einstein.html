A co-written book by Infeld and Einstein. Wow. Old, so can get a legally free copy here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/evolutionofphysi033254mbp" class="urlextern" title="https://archive.org/details/evolutionofphysi033254mbp" rel="ugc nofollow">https://archive.org/details/evolutionofphysi033254mbp</a>

Man, I like this book. Less story and more discoveries, questions, etc. No math, but maybe that&#039;s a feature too.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Heat capacity is weird. I know that when heating up the same mass of water and alcohol, it takes more energy to raise water one degree. But…the amount of “stuff” is the same! So where is the energy going? What is temperature anyway? (explained later in book I think or Wikipedia)</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Answer: stored in the degrees of freedom of the molecule (think the bop it game). Interesting….</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The number of gas particles in a equal volume, temperature, and “weighted” piston means that the number of particles are the same?!</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Brownian motion was uncovered by Brown and 80 years later <strong>someone</strong> (Einstein <img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="icon" alt=":-)" />) wrote why it happened. No name dropping, just a clear and exciting explanation of brownian motion and its applications to determining the mass of atoms. <img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="icon" alt=":-)" /></div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> <em>I think you could also determine the average number of atoms surrounding it too…by determining the variance which will tell you the mean of the poisson distribution!</em></div>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Einstein explained things in basic language so that one could understand immediately what he was talking about.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> They both also didn&#039;t trust anything until they completely understood it. Even Infeld had to catch himself assuming Einstein always did things correctly.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> “Excited and happy, I went home with the manuscript of Einstein&#039;s paper. I felt the anticipation of intense emotions which always accompany scientific work: the sleepless nights in which imagination is most vivid and the controlling criticism weakest, the ecstasy of seeing the light, the despair when a long and tedious road leads nowhere; the attractive mixture of happiness and unhappiness. All this was before me, raised to the highest level because I was working in the best place in the world. ”</div>

<div class="level3">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Einstein: “…I believe with Schopenhauer that one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and sciences is to escape from everyday life, with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one&#039;s own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from personal life in to the world of objective perception and thought; this desire may be compared with the townsman&#039;s irresistible longing to escape from his noisy, cramped surroundings into the silence of high mountains, where the eye ranges freely through the still, pure air and fondly traces out the restful contours which look as if they were built for eternity. With this negative motive there goes a positive one. Man tries to make for himself, in the way that suits him best, a simplified and intelligible picture of the world and thus to overcome the world of experience, for which he tries to some extent to substitute this cosmos of his. This is what the painter, the poet, the speculative philosopher and the natural scientist do, each in his own fashion. He makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his emotional life, in order to find in this way the peace and security which he cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience. ”</div>

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It is the detached feeling of duty based on aloof, clear thinking. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Good, clear thinking leads ot kindness and loyalty because this is what makes life simpler, fuller, richer, diminishes friction and unhappiness in our environment and therefore also in our lives. A sound social attitude, helpfulness, friendliness, kindness, may come from both mind and heart, but… I learned to value more the second kind of decency that arises from clear thinking. <strong>Too often I have seen how emotions unsupported by clear thought are useless if not destructive.</strong></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Theory on why Einstein was so popular: a man talking about stars and predicting the solar eclipse change due to relativity <strong>immediately</strong> after World War I ended, where there were bodies lying on the ground and people looking for something other than war. He has a hope for humanity.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> “It took me a long time to realize that in his aloofness and isolation lie the simple keys leading to an understanding of many of his actions. I am quite sure that the day Einstein received the Nobel prize he was not in the slightest degree excited and that if he did not sleep well that it was because of a problem which was bothering him and not because of the scientific distinction. His Nobel prize medal, together with many others, is laid aside among papers, honorary degrees, and diplomas in the room where his secretary works, and I am sure that Einstein has no clear idea of what the medal looks like.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> He never reads articles about himself…he said that this helps him to be free. </div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> A colleague: “If Einstein dislikes his fame…why does he not do what ordinary people do?”</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> “He desires to loosen his ties with the outside world. The idea is to restrict his needs and, by this restriction, increase his freedom. We are slaves of millions of things, and our slavery progresses steadily. For a week I tried an electric razor–and one more slavery entered my life. I dreaded spending the summer where there was no electric current. We are slaves of bathrooms, Frigidaires, cars, radios, and millions of other things. Einstein tried to reduce them to the absolute minimum. Long hair minimizes the need for the barber. Socks can be done without. One leather jacket solves the coat problem for many years. Suspenders are superfluous, as are nightshirts and pajamas. It is a minimum problem which Einstein has solved, and shoes, trousers, jacket, are the very necessary things; it would be difficult to reduce them further.”</div>
