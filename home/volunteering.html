Actually, it looks like it would be deductible (and thus eligible for matching by Intel), as long as you&#039;re “working” for most of the time. <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-deduct-expenses-volunteering-charity.html" class="urlextern" title="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-deduct-expenses-volunteering-charity.html" rel="ugc nofollow">https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-deduct-expenses-volunteering-charity.html</a>
</p>
<blockquote  class="blockquote-plugin">
<p>
Travel expenses are one of the most common deductions by volunteers. These include:
•	air, rail, and bus transportation
•	car expenses where travel is done by car
•	taxi fares or other costs of transportation between the airport or station and hotel
•	lodging costs, and
•	the cost of meals.
</p>

<p>
Example: Betty is a troop leader for a tax-exempt youth group and helps take the group on a camping trip. Betty is responsible for overseeing the setup of the camp and for providing adult supervision for other activities during the entire trip. Betty participated in the activities of the group and enjoyed her time with them. She oversaw the breaking of camp and helped transport the group home. Betty can deduct her travel expenses.

<p>
It&#039;s ok to receive something personally for what you gave, but the fair market value is not deductible.

Todo: See what Intel&#039;s policy on matching is.

<p>
Seems to be they&#039;ll only match the non-deductible part, which makes sense. But in the context of volunteering / mentoring, what is non-deductible? <a href="../_media/money/intelemgpguidelinesfaqs2019.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="money:intelemgpguidelinesfaqs2019.pdf">intelemgpguidelinesfaqs2019.pdf</a>

</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You can submit requests to share about MM throughout Newsong HERE. That team determines the best means and platforms to share what&#039;s happening at Newsong with the best audiences. I have talked with Rey that really the best promotion is organic - a friend telling a friend who tells a friend. That&#039;s how a lot of causes gain energy and momentum at Newsong. Because there&#039;s SO much going on at Newsong (cause, events, groups, meetings) our team has to make the hard decisions of what gets shared with who and when. Therefore, that word of mouth is really most powerful.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I would ask that your ENTIRE MM team read the book Toxic Charity. In fact, if you do, Newsong will reimburse you for reading the book. I would also connect you with a Cause Coach to walk your team through what you&#039;re reading in the book to help you process it. It&#039;s a really important book about how so many of the things we do are actually hurtful to “those in need” instead of transformational. We&#039;ve already had about 20+ cause leaders at Newsong read this book and it&#039;s changing the way we think here.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Connect with Shevawn Ramsey (mrswumbe@yahoo.com) about your team participating in the next book club monthly meetings for Cause. They will start meeting again in September and are reading/discussing When Helping Hurts: How to Alleviate Poverty Without Hurting the Poor . . . and Yourself. </div>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We have received a list of organizations from Vinny of shelters that he is familiar with and we will post it soon. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Please let me know <abbr title="As soon as possible">ASAP</abbr> if you would like to read through the book Toxic Charity with us and an assigned Cause Coach from Newsong. Also, if you would like to be a part of the monthly book club meetings for Cause please post here as well. </div>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you&#039;re going to retreat and we have some free time, it would be great if we could try to meet and finalize some decisions (i.e. the leadership team, bible study on Saturday, etc.). </div>
