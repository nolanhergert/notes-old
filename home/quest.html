<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Hendre studied and went to seminary before doing his restoring work in South Africa after apartheid. However, seminary / God? didn&#039;t really help him fix the problem down there. He studied <strong>behavioral science</strong> and got classes from the government as part of his training.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Hendre asks the person “what do you think you should do?” instead of telling them. Usually there is no action with the latter.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Hendre always asks “Would you like me to ask you some questions?” before he starts.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Hendre <strong>lives out</strong> what he talks about. He doesn&#039;t need a script! He is the script!</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Sam (the other leader), even if he messes up on a few words, isn&#039;t as good of a speaker as Hendre in saying clear statements, calling out people, and is shy/indecisive/etc in nature, he doesn&#039;t let his limitations/shortfalls stop him from doing what he intends to do in communicating with people in love. Wow. :)</div>
