what struck you about gus ?
they were clearly opposites, him and hazel
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:09 PM
err, his ability to commit despite knowing of the parts of Hazel. or maybe he read her well and did know about her deeply
6:10 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
i think it seemed like a hand in hand thing: he read her well enough, and as time passed he got to know the deep parts of her
that and he had an overall theme of, it would be a privilege for you to break my heart, but on the off chance that you don&#039;t, i&#039;m more than just friends with you
and i&#039;m willing to explore our connection/relationship
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:12 PM
hmm
I think what strikes me is that he wanted to commit to her
*her*
like‚Ä¶why would you want to hang out with a partially depressed person?
6:18 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
haha!
i kind of wnat to read the book‚Ä¶
i can&#039;t believe i&#039;m saying that, i never want to read the book after the movie
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:19 PM
why not hang out with idealists such as yourself?
6:19 PM
Nolan Hergert
why me? the opposite of you?
‚Äúopposite‚Äù meaning definitely not the same
6:19 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
it would be repetitious
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:20 PM
well, especially a depressed individual
meaning, repetitious in the really tiring sense
6:21 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
haha
yes
well
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:21 PM
‚ÄúWell Hazel Grace‚Ä¶.you are the most beautiful girl to walk the planet‚Äù
6:22 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
there&#039;s always hope, that&#039;s part of gus&#039;s character and his story
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:22 PM
‚Äúand I can&#039;t stop wanting to hang around you‚Äù
6:22 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
isn&#039;t it sweet tho?
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:23 PM
yeah! had the rest of the movie not been executed so well, I would not have recommended it
as he&#039;s delusional or something
6:24 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
so u do not like gus&#039;s character
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:24 PM
mmm, I like it after watching the rest of the movie but I need to re-watch it a few times to really absorb it
for myself
to let the raindrops water my parched soul
6:26 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
whoa whoa, put the gun down nolar
but on the real
do u relate more to the hazel character
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:27 PM
very easily
6:28 PM
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
makes sense
all i can say is, i can see why gus likes her
and i can see why, even with hesitation that hazel likes him back
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
6:28 PM
why does Gus like her?
why would he pour all that time and energy into her? (especially before she starts opening up)
hehe
I have been silently asking that of other people for a while now
57 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
maybe you should ask ‚Äúgus&#039;s‚Äù
gus&#039; plural
gus like characters
people
if you ask hazel type ppl then ur gonna get a reinforcement of your own belief system
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
52 mins
yikes
51 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
right?
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
51 mins
I have forgotten what ppl say because they aren&#039;t explained from a Hazel perspective
51 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
‚Ä¶
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
50 mins
hehe
50 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
i think
i will
perpetually, shake my head
probably laughing while i do it
listening to this rhetoric
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
50 mins
err, like‚Ä¶I want to hear it from a Hazel-turned-Gus
hmm
&lt;sigh&gt;
49 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
but hazel doesn&#039;t become gus
so
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
49 mins
maybe I&#039;ll ask my internal questions out loud
49 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
at least story wise, she doesn&#039;t change , the character she holds stays the same, she&#039;s still critical and she&#039;s still all the things before
what&#039;s your internal question
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
48 mins
‚Äúare you sure?!‚Äù
‚Äúwhy are you so sure?‚Äù
‚Äì&gt; I&#039;m not but I choose into it üòÉ
47 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
hehe!
Dorothy

well first of all, no one explodes bec a relationship ends
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
47 mins
no, like mind exploding
47 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
i know
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
47 mins
sorry, texts are inefficient
47 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
i hear you making the sound right now
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
46 mins
k
46 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
but they help you form your thoughts
u&#039;ve had the time to gather your thoughts
anyway, secondly, there&#039;s no guarantee you can know everything about someone, the best you can do is spend time with them
ask them questions
do fun things with them
do not fun things with them
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
45 mins
‚Äúno one explodes bec a relationship ends‚Äù
meaning?
44 mins
Nolan Hergert
Dorothy Lau
i&#039;m saying, its not the end of the world if it doesn&#039;t work
from a gus point of view, the risk of this relationship not working, is worth committing to it until it absolutely doesn&#039;t work, bec the truth is that it could work, u just don&#039;t know it till you try it
Dorothy
 ‚Ä¢ 
39 mins
Dorothy Lau
and if you&#039;re trying it, why not commit, because you may as well have the best foot forward if you&#039;re risking both the potential of failing and the potential of succeeding
